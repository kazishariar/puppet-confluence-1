# 1.) Place this file in your hieradata directory
# 2.) Modify the database settings below according to your setup
#
# Atlassian jira Git Enterprise Source Control Server
jira::jira_name: jira
jira::version: 5.1.7
jira::format: tar.gz

# Directory where the webapp will run from
jira::installdir: /opt/jira
# If you can put this on another filesystem, and even better, a fs that's
# on another physical disk, you will be happier, but not required
jira::homedir: /opt/jira-home
# What user should jira run as
# Puppet will make the user
jira::user: jira
jira::group: jira

# Database configuration - please change these according to your setup
# Comment out or uncomment for your db product as this value is also
# overloaded as the jdbc driver db
jira::db: postgresql
#jira::db: mysql
#jira::db: oracle

jira::dbtype: postgres72
#jira::dbtype: mysql

jira::dbdriver: org.postgresql.Driver
#jira::dbdriver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

# Change these values to your jira database credentials
jira::dbuser: jiraadm
jira::dbpassword: jiraadm

jira::dbname: jira
# Change port depending on your db product
jira::dbport: 5432
#jira::dbport: 3306
#jira::dbport: 1521

# The connection pool size
jira::poolsize: 15

# Change if your database isn't on localhost.  This module will only check
# to make sure that the service is running and start it if it is not on
# localhost db's only.  So if your remote database, which is suggested, isn't
# available, that's your fault.
jira::dbserver: localhost

# Tomcat configuration
# TODO because I'm never a fan of the stock tomcat settings
jira::javahome: /opt/java/jdk1.6.0_33
jira::jvm_xmx: 1024m
jira::jvm_optional: -XX:-HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
#jira::jvm_optional: -XX:NewSize=256m -XX:MaxNewSize=256m -XX:SurvivorRatio=16
# the New and SR figures are purely optional
# for heap dumps add -XX:-HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
# by default jira has 256m permgen which is a good setting to go with
